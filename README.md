## General Information
- Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters.If one is   able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such           applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

- loan.csv is used which has all the loan data.
